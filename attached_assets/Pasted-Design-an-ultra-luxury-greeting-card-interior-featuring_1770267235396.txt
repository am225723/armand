Design an ultra-luxury greeting card interior featuring the provided poem text.
Use an extremely refined, formal calligraphy font, inspired by master copperplate and Spencerian penmanship, with dramatic thick-and-thin stroke contrast, smooth flowing curves, elegant flourished capital letters, and graceful ascenders and descenders. The calligraphy should look hand-lettered by a professional calligrapher, not digitally typed.
The final line “Is To Be Known” should be larger, more ornate, and visually emphasized with elegant swashes and decorative flourishes.
Place the poem on premium handmade paper with a soft ivory or warm white tone. The paper should have a subtle natural texture, very light parchment aging, and gentle ink absorption for realism. Keep the background clean and uncluttered.
Center the poem with generous margins and balanced line spacing. Use refined ornamental divider lines or subtle baroque-style flourishes between poem sections. Optional delicate gold or champagne accents may appear only in decorative flourishes, not in the text.
The overall design should feel timeless, celebratory, romantic, and heirloom-quality, suitable for a keepsake greeting card. Typography must be highly legible, elegant, and professional.
Output a high-resolution, portrait-oriented, print-ready greeting card interior.
