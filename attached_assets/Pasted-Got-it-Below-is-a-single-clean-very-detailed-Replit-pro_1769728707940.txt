Got it. Below is a single, clean, very detailed Replit prompt you can paste directly into Replit (or any “AI generate app” field). It is written to force a much higher-quality result, especially for:
	•	realistic handwriting (no straight-line wipe)
	•	expressive ink pressure
	•	paper texture + ink bleed
	•	a strong, memorable front-of-card interaction using the candle → arrow idea

You don’t need to explain anything around it—just paste this as-is.

🔥 REPLIT PROMPT (FULL, HIGH-DETAIL)

Build an advanced React web app that functions as a cinematic, interactive eBirthday card. This should feel handcrafted, emotional, and tactile—not like a standard animation demo.

1. FRONT OF THE CARD (FIRST IMPRESSION)

When the site loads, show ONLY the front of a closed birthday card, centered on the screen.
No poem, no photos yet.

Front interaction concept:
	•	The main visual element is a birthday candle that doubles as an arrow.
	•	The candle wick is subtly animated (small flame flicker, soft glow).
	•	The candle is nocked onto a stylized bow (minimalist, elegant—not cartoonish).
	•	The user can click and drag the candle backward, stretching the bowstring.
	•	As the candle is pulled back:
	•	The flame elongates slightly
	•	The glow intensifies
	•	A subtle tension sound or visual vibration can occur (optional)
	•	When the user releases:
	•	The candle-arrow fires forward
	•	This triggers a page-opening / card-flip animation
	•	The front of the card opens smoothly into the inside view

This interaction should feel intentional and delightful, like opening a physical keepsake.

2. INSIDE OF THE CARD (LAYOUT)

Once opened, the card displays two pages:

LEFT PAGE – PHOTOS
	•	Show up to 3 photos in a Polaroid-style layout
	•	Each photo:
	•	Slight rotation (different angles)
	•	Soft drop shadow
	•	White Polaroid border
	•	Optional handwritten-style caption underneath
	•	Photos should feel casually placed, not grid-aligned

RIGHT PAGE – HANDWRITTEN POEM
	•	Display a poem written line-by-line using the custom font
Font name (must be used exactly): InterSignature-q20q2
	•	The font file already exists in the project and must be loaded properly via @font-face or FontFace API.

⸻

3. HANDWRITING ANIMATION (CRITICAL)

The handwriting must NOT be a simple horizontal mask or straight wipe.

Instead:
	•	Simulate real pen motion, including:
	•	Slight curved paths
	•	Variable stroke direction
	•	Natural pauses at commas, line breaks, and punctuation
	•	Ink pressure variation:
	•	Stroke starts thin
	•	Thickens through the middle of the line
	•	Tapers at the end
	•	Emphasized words should:
	•	Appear slightly darker or thicker
	•	Have a tiny pause before or after writing
	•	Optionally show a subtle glow or ink pooling

This should feel like a hand actually writing—imperfect, expressive, and organic.

⸻

4. PAPER & INK REALISM

The poem page should look like real paper:
	•	Add a subtle paper grain texture (light noise or fiber effect)
	•	Add ink bleed:
	•	Slight feathering around strokes
	•	Soft blurred underlayer beneath the main text
	•	Avoid anything harsh or digital-looking

⸻

5. AUDIO SYNC (OPTIONAL BUT ALWAYS DRIVING TIMING)
	•	An audio file exists in the project named:
LukesPoem.mp3
	•	The user can choose to press Play, but even if they don’t, the handwriting animation should still follow the same timing as if the audio were playing silently.
	•	When audio is played:
	•	The handwriting must sync precisely to the spoken lines
	•	Audio currentTime should drive animation progress
	•	When audio is not played:
	•	Use the same internal timing map so emphasis and pacing remain identical

⸻

6. UX & POLISH
	•	All animations should use smooth easing (no linear motion)
	•	Everything must be responsive (desktop + mobile)
	•	Avoid heavy libraries unless absolutely necessary
	•	Prefer SVG, CSS, and React state over canvas unless needed
	•	The experience should feel like a digital keepsake, not a tech demo

⸻

7. OVERALL GOAL

This project should feel:
	•	intimate
	•	handcrafted
	•	emotionally intentional

Imagine the user opening this once a year and smiling every time.

Do not simplify the handwriting animation. Do not replace it with a basic mask. Prioritize realism over speed of implementation.

If you want, next I can:
	•	rewrite this prompt for Claude / GPT-4 / Replit Agent specifically
	•	give you a step-by-step build order
	•	or sketch the exact SVG strategy to avoid the “straight-line reveal” problem entirely
